<h2>IPAC Containerization Workshop</h2>

<p>This year, in conjunction with GRITS, we are planning to hold a "Containerization Workshop".  Scientists and engineering staff are encouraged to participate in this workshop.</p>

<p>The workshop content will include an introduction to the use of containers: what they are, how they differ from virtual machines, how they work, pros and cons, and how they can be used by both scientists and engineers. We'll have a series of "IPAC Stories" from staff who are already making use of containers on IPAC projects, and then hold two "hands-on" sessions where participants will have the opportunity to create and deploy containers. We'll also have a short introduction to container administration.</p>

<p><b>Date:</b> Thursday, Sept 12 (the day before GRITS)<br />
<b>Location:</b> Keith Spalding Building 4th floor conference room (KS 410)<br />
<b>Time:</b>8:15am-5:30pm</p>
